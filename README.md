## Installation

To install GDBT you can use this one-liner:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ironsource-mobile/gdbt/main/install.sh)"
```

### Alternative method

If you prefer manual installation, download wheel file from [release](https://github.com/ironsource-mobile/gdbt/releases/latest) page. Make sure you keep the wheel file name as is, otherwise you won't be able to install it.

Install GDBT from wheel:

```bash
pip3 install ./gdbt-2.2.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

Refer to *[CLI reference](#cli)* for further info.

## Reference

### Concepts

**Resource**. A single object in Grafana, either folder or a dashboard.

**Resource definition**. GDBT configuration file. Describes resource kind and its model as well as relevant lookups, evaluations and loops.

**Scope**. A subdirectory of the whole GDBT configuration that includes a subset of resource definitions. You can run GDBT against any available scope, keeping other resources unaffected. This can be done by either running GDBT from a subdirectory or using `-s` / `--scope` option.

**Lookup**. Static key-value configuration, useful for mapping or easy template variable modification. Available as `lookups` dictionary in the template.

**Evaluation**. Dynamic variant of lookup. Can be used to retrieve values at runtime, for example — fetch a list of metric label values from Prometheus.

**Evaluation lock**. Evaluations are cached in lock files to make sure that identical code *always* generates identical resource set. The lock files are stored beside resource definitions with the same filename and `.lock` extension. To update the lock file, run your command with `-u` or `--update` flag. Locks are updated automatically when relevant evaluation definition is changed.

**Loop**. Allows you to iterate over an array, making a separate resource for each array item. The iterable can be provided from an evaluation or a lookup. Current item is available in the template as `loop.item`.

### Global configuration

Used for global preferences, like defining providers or state storage configuration. It is written in TOML and always resides in the root directory of your configuration as `config.toml`.

Example configuration:

```toml
[providers]

[providers.example-grafana]
kind = "grafana"
endpoint = "https://grafana.example.com"
token = "$GRAFANA_TOKEN"

[providers.example-prometheus]
kind = "prometheus"
endpoint = "http://prometheus.example.com:8248"
http_proxy = "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
https_proxy = "http://proxy.example.com:8443"

[providers.state-s3]
kind = "s3"
bucket = "example-gdbt-state"

[state]
provider = "state-s3"

[concurrency]
threads = 16

```

- `providers`: provider definitions:
  - `kind`: provider kind, one of `grafana`, `prometheus` (for evaluations), `s3`, `consul`, `file` (for state storage)
  - *other provider-specific parameters*
- `state`: state storage preferences
  - `provider`: name of provider used for state storage (*at the moment only S3 is supported*)
- `concurrency`: parallelism preferences
  - `threads`: how many threads to run for HTTP requests to APIs (*Note: you may experience heavy API rate limiting if you set this value too high, so try to find a sweet spot considering your resource limitations*)

You can use environment variables inside this configuration as `"$VARIABLE_NAME"`. Note: these should be enclosed in quotes.

### Resource definitions

There are 2 kinds of resources: `dashboard` and `folder`, each of these corresponding to relevant Grafana entities.

Path to the resource definition relative to configuration root (without `.yaml` extension) is designated as the resource identifier. When resource definition produces multiple resources (e.g. when using `loop`), the loop item value is appended to resource identifier with a colon symbol (`example/resource:foo`, `example/resource:bar`).

Example `dashboard` resource with multiple notification channels per service:

```yaml
kind: dashboard
provider: example-grafana
folder: example/foo/folder
evaluations:
  example-services:
    kind: prometheus
    source: example-prometheus
    metric: "sum(cpu_user_usage) by (service)[30m]"
    label: service
loop: evaluations.example-services
lookups:
  service_notification_channel:
    service1:
      - victorops-team1
      - slack-team1
    service2:
      - victorops-team1
      - mail-all
    service3:
      - slack-team2
    DEFAULT:
      - mail-all
model: |
  {
    "panels": [
      {
        "alert": {
          "name": "CPU usage high in {{ loop.item }} service",
          "notifications": [
            {%- for notification_channel in lookups.service_notification_channel[loop.item] | default(lookups.service_notification_channel.DEFAULT) %}
            {
              "uid": "{$ notification_channel -$}"
            }{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}
          ]
        },
        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "avg by (service)(cpu_user_usage{service='{{ loop.item }}'})",
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "tags": ["example", "cpu", "{{ loop.item }}"],
    "title": "System CPU usage ({{ loop.item }})"
  }
```

Example `dashboard` resource with one notification channel per service:

```yaml
kind: dashboard
provider: example-grafana
folder: example/foo/folder
evaluations:
  example-services:
    kind: prometheus
    source: example-prometheus
    metric: "sum(cpu_user_usage) by (service)[30m]"
    label: service
loop: evaluations.example-services
lookups:
  service_notification_channel:
    service1: victorops-team1
    service2: victorops-team1
    service3: slack-team2
    DEFAULT: mail-all
model: |
  {
    "panels": [
      {
        "alert": {
          "name": "CPU usage high in {{ loop.item }} service",
          "notifications": [
            {
              "uid": "{$ lookups.service_notification_channel[loop.item] | default(lookups.service_notification_channel.DEFAULT) $}"
            }
          ]
        },
        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "avg by (service)(cpu_user_usage{service='{{ loop.item }}'})",
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "tags": ["example", "cpu", "{{ loop.item }}"],
    "title": "System CPU usage ({{ loop.item }})"
  }
```

*Note: `model` in the above example was stripped and only relevant fields were left. Please refer to Grafana documentation for valid resource model JSON format.

Example `folder` resource:

```yaml
kind: folder
provider: example-grafana
model: |
  {
    "title": "Example Folder"
  }
```

- `kind`: either of `folder`, `dashboard`
- `provider`: name of Grafana provider this resource will be applied to
- `folder` *(only for `dashboard` kind)*: resource identifier of folder the dashboard will be created in
- `evaluations` *(optional)*: dynamic lookups:
  - `kind`: evaluation kind, only `prometheus` is supported at the moment
  - `source`: provider name to run the evaluation against
  - `metric`: metric to evaluate
  - `label`: name of label to extract from received metric set
- `lookups` *(optional)*: static lookups, a simple key-value
- `loop` *(optional)*: loop against specified variable, will generate a resource for each item in provided variable
- `model`: Jinja2 template of Grafana resource model JSON

See [Jinja2 documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/) for more info about templates.

#### Caveats

Grafana forbids creating resources with identical titles. Because of this, be extra careful when using `loop`, ensure that you include `{{ loop.item }}` as a part of `title` — otherwise you will get unexpected cryptic errors from Grafana.

### CLI

```text
gdbt [command] [parameters] [options]
```

Use `--help` for information on specific command. The synopsis for each command shows its parameters and their usage.

#### Commands

- `validate`: Validate syntax:
  - `-s` / `--scope`: Scope (default: current working directory).
- `plan`: Generates an execution plan for GDBT:
  - `-u` / `--update`: Update evaluation locks.
- `apply`: Build or change Grafana resources according to the configuration in the current scope:
  - `-s` / `--scope`: Scope (default: current working directory);
  - `-u` / `--update`: Update evaluation locks;
  - `-y` / `--auto-approve`: Do not ask for confirmation.
- `destroy`: Remove all defined resources within the current scope:
  - `-s` / `--scope`: Scope (default: current working directory);
  - `-u` / `--update`: Update evaluation locks;
  - `-y` / `--auto-approve`: Do not ask for confirmation.
- `version`: Print GDBT version.

## Development

Before starting, please read [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ironsource-mobile/gdbt/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*Note:* This repo uses *main* as a default branch. Make sure you don't use *master* accidentally.

### How does it work?

Here's a flow of GDBT code:

1. Query GitHub for new GDBT releases. If a valid release with a latter version is found, display a message, otherwise skip to the next step.
2. Read evaluation cache from lock files. If lock file hash doesn't match, or `-u` flag was provided, query Prometheus (VictoriaMetrics) and write the new evaluation result to the lock file.
3. If `loop` option is provided, assign a *resource* for each loop item. Otherwise, a single resource is assigned.
4. For every resource, query Grafana and fetch JSON model of a dashboard (or a folder).
5. Calculate the difference between the configured and actual state of resources, and make it into a plan.
6. If the command is `apply` — apply the plan by querying Grafana and sending JSON models of the resources

### Source code structure

All source code can be found under `gdbt` directory:

- **`code`** — configuration and templates parsing
- **`dynamic`** — implementation of *lookup* and *evaluation* concepts
- **`errors`** — error handling
- **`provider`** — provider-specific code which implements provider interface
- **`resource`** — implementation of Grafana Resource object
- **`state`** — state and plan calculation related code
- **`cli.py`** — main program, definition of CLI commands

### Standards

GDBT code shall follow OOP patterns. You can learn more [here](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/). Code style shall be [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html). Code shall be formatted using Black formatter, [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) and linted with [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/#).
All dependencies shall be managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs).
GDBT releases shall strictly follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) scheme.

### Prerequisites

To work on this project you need:

- Python 3.8+ (using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) is heavily recommended)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- IDE with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black#installation-and-usage) formatter, [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/#installation) linter and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/#installing-isort) tool installed

### Using Poetry

This project uses Poetry as a dependency management tool. It has a lot of advantages before plain pip, for example:

- automatic virtual env management
- better dependency management
- build system
- integration with test frameworks

Here are some example actions you should know:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment and get a shell inside
poetry shell

# Install the app with all dependencies
poetry install

# Add a new dependency (identical to pip install x when not using Poetry)
poetry add x

# Remove a dependency
poetry remove x

# Bump package version (level is one of patch, minor, major)
poetry version level

# Run a command in the virtual environment
poetry run x

# Update dependencies
poetry update

# Build package wheel
poetry build -f wheel
```

All dependencies should be added using Poetry: `poetry add x`. Please try to reuse existing dependencies to avoid bloating the package; you can find the list of these in `pyproject.toml` or by running `poetry show`.

Please specify any additional dependencies in module docstring.

#### Documentation

This tool uses Python docstrings for documentation purposes. Those docstrings should follow [Google's docstrings style guide](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html). You should use docstrings module documentation, reference, TODOs etc.

### Building

This package is distributed as a [wheel](https://realpython.com/python-wheels/). This simplifies installation and dependency management on target systems.

Normally you should use stable CI-built wheels, available on Releases page. In case you need a development wheel for testing, you can always build one yourself:

```bash
poetry build -f wheel
```

You can find the built wheel in *dist* directory. *Note:* wheel file name contains package metadata, so do not rename the file, otherwise you might not be able to install it!

### Releases

**GDBT** follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) guidelines. Version numbers don't include *v* prefix *unless* it is a tag name (i.e., tags look like `v1.2.3`, everything else — `1.2.3`).

All changes are kept track of in the changelog, which can be found in *CHANGELOG.md* file. This file follows *[keep-a-changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)* format. Please make yourself familiar with it before contributing.

Generally, you should test your changes before creating a release. After that, create a *release candidate* pre-release, using the instruction below. Version number should be `1.2.3-rc.1` — an upcoming release version number with RC suffix. After extensively testing the release candidate, you can proceed to creating a release.

#### Release process

0. Checkout *main* branch.
1. Run `poetry version minor` (or `major` or `patch`, depending on severity of changes in the release). This will bump project version in `pyproject.toml`.
2. Change `[Unreleased]` H2 header in *CHANGELOG.md* to the new release version (e.g., `[1.2.3]`).
3. Add current date in ISO format (`YYYY-DD-MM`) after the header (e.g., `[1.2.3] - 2011-12-13`).
4. Add new `[Unreleased]` H2 header above all version headers.
5. Add compare link at the bottom of *CHANGELOG.md* as follows:
`[1.2.3]: https://github.com/ironsource-mobile/gdbt/compare/v1.2.2...v1.2.3` right below `[unreleased]` link (replace `1.2.3` with the new release version, `1.2.2` with the previous release version).
6. Change version in `[unreleased]` link at the bottom of *CHANGELOG.md* to the new release version (e.g., `[unreleased]: https://github.com/ironsource-mobile/gdbt/compare/v1.2.3...HEAD`).
7. Commit the changes to *main* branch. Commit message should be `Release v1.2.3`.
8. Create a release tag: `git tag v1.2.3`. This should be a *lightweight* tag, not an annotated one.
9. Push the changes and tag to GitHub: `git push && git push --tags`.

If you find the above instructions unclear, take a look at previous releases or contact project maintainers.

### CI/CD

This repo uses GitHub Actions as CI/CD tool. Pipeline config can be found in *.github/workflows/ci-release.yaml* file.

As of now, the only pipeline is *Release*: it builds the wheel and creates a release in GitHub. It is triggered on tags that start with *v* prefix.
